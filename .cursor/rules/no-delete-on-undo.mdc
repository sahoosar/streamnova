# No File Deletion on Undo / Revert

- **Do not delete project source files** when reverting, undoing, or rolling back changes.
- If the user asks to undo or revert edits to a file, **restore the previous content** by editing the file (search-replace or full write), not by deleting the file.
- When applying the inverse of a change (e.g. removing a feature that was added), prefer **editing the file back to its prior state** rather than deleting the file.
- Only delete a file when the user **explicitly asks** to delete or remove that file.

This avoids losing files when undo or revert is used and keeps the project structure intact.
